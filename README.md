# JavaScript Quiz

For this repository, I wrote the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this code assestment in creating a multiple-choice question quiz.

### Tasks

* This quiz will start with a smooth "Start Quiz" button.
* At the top left you can find the "View High Scores" section that contains localStorage documentation.
* At the top right you can find the "Time" countdown of 60 seconds for the student to take the quiz.
* The quiz is composed of 4 questions.
* For each incorrect question, the time will be subtracted from the clock.
* The quiz will end when the time reaches 0 or when the student answers all questions before the time has ended with a "game over" message providing their score with their initials.
